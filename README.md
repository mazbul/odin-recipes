# odin-recipes

This project is a basic recipe website built to practice HTML skills. 
The website features a main index page that links to multiple recipe pages, each showing different recipes.
Through this project, I aim to demonstrate my ability to create well-structured HTML documents using semantic elements, proper linking between pages, and organizing content effectively.
